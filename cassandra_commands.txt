** These commands assume that the path had been set for cassandra in the PATH variable

* to run cassandra just write
' cassandra '

* check the status of the nodes (nodetool basically helps in everything that deals with cassandra) 
‘ nodetool status ‘ 

* for further information
‘ nodetool help ‘

* to run the cqlsh shell
‘ cqlsh ‘

** some cqlsh commands (pretty much similar to normal sql)
* Create a keycap
‘ CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1 }; ’

* create a table in that keyspace 
‘ USE "test"; ‘
‘ CREATE TABLE my_table(key text PRIMARY KEY, value int); ‘

* store some goodies
‘ INSERT INTO my_table(key, value) VALUES ('key1', 1); ‘
‘ INSERT INTO my_table(key, value) VALUES ('key2', 2); ‘

* and retrieve them again
‘ SELECT * from my_table; ’
