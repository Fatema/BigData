** make sure you start up docker first

* for basic version info
	docker -v

* show more detailed version information 
	docker version

* show the entire information about the containers, storage used, ..etc
	docker info

* for a full list of the commands (help)
	docker -h

* for the docker commands info/help
	docker <command> --help

* start up a new container, make it interactive and assign it a TTY, then base the container on an Ubuntu image and inside the container run the bash process 
	docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
to run a CentOS
	docker run -it centos /bin/bash
can use all the commands related to ubunto or centos inside each container

* to connect docker through a host (works on ubuntu terminal, byt maybe not mac need a proper host to test it and i don't want to bother with VM)
	docker -H 192.168.99.1:2375 -d &
then after that in the other machine
	export DOCKER_HOST='<docker host>'
now the docker running on the machine is the hosted docker

* to remove a container
	docker rm -f <container name>

* to remove an image
	docker rmi <image name>

* to check the current running containers
	docker ps
for stopped containers just add ‘-a’

* to go back into a container (first make sure it’s started)
	docker attach <name or id of container>
